Hi Andrew,



As we talk about in the meeting, we would appreciate it greatly if we could see a demo android app from you.



For simplicity, I think a simple fibonacci sequence app would get you a feel of android & kotlin.

I attached a simple UI so you don’t need to go too fancy on it.

( P.S click the “Next” button to get the next number )



I understand Android development is very imitating at first, so here are some libraries / tools that google recommend to make it easier.



UI – Constraint Layout

MVC – LiveData, Data Binding, ViewModel

Unit Test – junit, Robolectric



Please feel free to let me know if you got any problems =)



Best regards,

Kaga
